\large{Adventure Story} \\ \\
This is a story about four friends who took a walk in the park. One of the four got lost, so the remaining three (Alice, Bob, and Candice) all decided that they would split up and look for their lost friend, Diego. This story took place in 1974 so nobody had a cell phone on their person.\\
