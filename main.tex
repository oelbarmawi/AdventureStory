\large{Adventure Story} \\ \\
This is a story about four friends who took a walk in the park. One of the four got lost, so the remaining three (Alice, Bob, and Candice) all decided that they would split up and look for their lost friend, Diego. This story took place in 1974 so nobody had a cell phone on their person.\\
Diego has always been suspect so it did not come as a surprise to anyone that he found himself in a situation in which a search party was looking for him. Nevertheless, his friends had to come up with a strategy in order to find him. Alice decided to check the lake that had ducks because she knows of Diego's obsession with ducks, Bob was going to check the open field area that contained all of the people tanning because he knew Diego would never refuse a chance to tan, and finally, Candice was going to check the coffee shop that was in the park because she knew that Diego is addicted to caffeine.\\
While Alice was looking for Diego at the lake, she noticed that there was one particularly large duck, roughly the size of an ostrich. This duck was so large, it attracted the attention of almost everyone in the vicinity. Alice when to investigate the crowd but she was unsuccessful in finding Diego in the crowd.
